## Introduction
In this project, I performed vulnerability audits on a Kali Linux system using the following tools:
- **Lynis**: An open-source auditing tool for Unix-based systems.
- **CIS Benchmark**: A framework for system hardening developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS).

The audit was conducted in several stages, including an initial audit using Lynis, implementing the recommended changes, and verifying improvements using a second audit. Additionally, the CIS recommendations were applied to further harden the system.
